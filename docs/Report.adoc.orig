=== Functionalities

*Customer*

Each customer should be able to create and update their user account details.
When making an order, customers are able to browse for food items by (i) area (ii) restaurant (iii) food name (iv) food category.
Upon making their order, customers can apply promotion codes and rewards points to their order.
Finally, each customer should be able to view their past order history, and reviews of food items from restaurant menu.

*Restaurant Staff*

Each restaurant staff should be able to create and update their user account details.
Restaurant staff should be able to view and update their restaurant menu.
Restaurant staff should be able to create new promotions for their restaurant, and view summary information of previous promotions. This includes the duration of the promotion, the total cost of order received, and the total number of orders received during promotion period.
Finally, they should also be able to view a monthly summary for order information. This includes the total number of orders, the cost of the orders, as well as the top 5 food choices for the month.

*Riders*

Each rider should be able to create and update their account details.
Riders should be able to view their delivery history, as well as their work schedule history.
They should also be able to declare weekly work schedules (WWS) (for part-timers) or their monthly work schedules (MWS) (for full-timers). The schedules declared should be in line with the FDS policy requirements (e.g. between 10 and 48 hours each week).
Finally, they should be able to view summary information for a particular month. This includes total salary, delivery fees earned, hours worked, average rating, average delivery time, and number of deliveries for the month.

*FDS Manager*

Each FDS manager should be able to create and update their account details.
FDS managers should be able to register restaurants into the application.
FDS managers should also be able to view monthly summary information. This includes total number of new customers, total number of orders made, and the total cost of all orders.
FDS managers should also be able to view an hourly summary information. This includes the total number of orders for each location, and the number of riders for each interval.
Finally, FDS managers should be able to view the monthly summary information that individual customers and riders have access to.


=== Interesting / Non-trivial Functions


== ER Model
=== Design considerations

(1) Promotions as an ISA relation to all sub promotions. By abstracting out attributes that are common to all promotions, we are able to achieve extensibility for promotions. This means it is easy to extend promotions and create more sub promotions. Restaurant Staff or the FDS Managers are able to create new types of sub promotions by identifying unique attributes which the sub promotion is based off.

By abstracting out key attributes of the promotion, different restaurants can now also create the same type of promotion but with the ability to customise it to their needs e.g. start and end date, rate of discount etc, different types of discount (Free delivery, %X Off, $X off, etc) and different promotion requirement (Spend a minimum of $10, Customer's last ordered delivery is 30 days ago)

=== Constraints not captured by Relational Schema

*Intervals* - For the same rider, no intervals should overlap with one another. There must be at least 1 hour of break between any 2 consecutive intervals. Intervals must fall within the start and end date of the WWS they belong to.

*Weekly Work Schedule* - For each worker, there should be no overlapping WWS. Each WWS must be at least 10 hours and at most 48 hours in total. Each WWS must be declared for exactly 7 consecutive days.

*Monthly Work Schedule* - For each week in of the MWS, the 4 comprising WWS must be equivalent. Each WWS should have 5 consecutive work days, that comprise of intervals using the pre-defined shifts for full-time riders. Each MWS should last for 28 days exactly, and there should not be any overlapping MWS for the same rider.

*Promotions* - Every promotion applied to an order has to be checked that it fulfils the promotions constraints such as the minAmount as well as timelastOrdered

*Riders* - During the operation hours of the FDS, there should be at least five riders (part-time or full-time) working at each hourly interval.

*Orders* - Quantity of food ordered for a particular food item cannot exceed it's availability. Total cost order must hit a certain minimum order amount set by the restaurant.

== Triggers
=== Ensure No Overlap Between Intervals
Trigger: interval_overlap_trigger

Function called: check_intervals_overlap_deferred()

This trigger makes sure that within a same schedule which belongs to only one rider, there must not exist an overlap of different intervals.
This is a different implementation from the `OVERLAPS` operator provided by PSQL. The `OVERLAPS` operator does not consider intervals with a single common endpoint to overlap but our implementation does, in order to better fit our use case.

This is done by ensuring:

* For two intervals belonging to the same schedule and falls on the same date, they do not have any properties of a wrong input schedule.

=== Ensure 5 Consecutive Days In Each WWS of a MWS
Trigger: mws_5days_trigger

Function: check_mws_5days_consecutive_constraint_deferred()

This is to enforce the constraint of “Each WWS in a MWS must consist of five consecutive work days”. The trigger makes sure that all intervals in a week (7 days) of the MWS selected by a full-time rider are of five consecutive days. This means that every day within the five consecutive days are work days with valid intervals.

This is done by ensuring:

* there are 5 distinct days that can be obtained from the work intervals for each week
* the difference between the first interval and the last interval of work is 4 days , i.e. all intervals fall within 5 days.

=== Ensure Intervals in MWS Follow Predefined Timings
Trigger: mws_predefined_interval_trigger

Function: check_mws_intervals_constraint_deferred()

This trigger enforces each work day to only consist of the predefined intervals for full-time riders (e.g. 10pm to 2pm, 3pm to 7pm). This is achieved by pairing intervals of the same day belonging to the same schedule to ensure that they follow the specified timings.

First, we join 2 Interval instances using the startTime of the intervals.
Then, we check:

* Each interval declared has a corresponding pair
* Intervals are 1 hour apart
* The first interval starts at 10am/11am/12pm/1pm
* Both intervals are 4 hours long

== Complex Queries
=== View Monthly Salary for Rider

This query calculates the amount of salary that a rider (part-time or full-time) receives for the month. First we find the detailed schedule of the rider by joining the interval table with the weekly schedule table. 

The salary calculation is as such: 

Base salary + Bonus salary.
Base salary is calculated by: Number of hours worked * Rate per hour. Rate per hour is determined by whether the rider is a part-timer ($2/h) or full timer($5/h). 

Bonus salary is calculated by: Number of deliveries($4 per delivery) made during peak hour (Between the periods of 12:00 - 13:00 and 18:00 - 20:00) + Number of deliveries($2 per delivery) made during non-peak hour.

=== Check current status for Rider

This is a complex query to find the current status of the rider. 

All riders will be in three states:

* Rider is not working 
* Rider is working and free to accept orders.
* Rider is working and currently delivering orders.

First, we find the detailed schedule of all riders by joining the schedule table and interval table. We check whether he is working or he is on his break at this current time. If he is working, we would check again to see if he is currently delivering or not by checking the expected delivery time to the customer.

== Conclusion/Summary

One particularly challenging factor that we faced was coding out a full stack development which consists of the front-end, back-end and the database. As some of us are relatively new to PERN (PostgresSQL, Express, Node.js and React) stack development, we have to research a lot to find out how each of the technology works and how to make sure each of them can be used cohesive with each other. We also had some difficulties coming up with various complex queries and triggers for the system. At many times, the queries that we came up with did not generate what we wanted, hence, quite some time was spent on debugging.

At times, we were also unsure of what the best practices are when building the app. For example, there were cases where we were uncertain if we should implement a logic in the backend or if we should handle it in the database as both ways are possible. Furthermore, when we first started on the project, we were unsure of how to design a good schema, i.e. what kind of attributes we should include in the schema. These were gradually made clearer to us in the later part of the module after we were introduced with concepts like normal forms, which taught us some properties to take note of when evaluating a schema.

From this project, we learnt that it is very important to determine how you will evaluate your system before implementation. We managed to incorporate a design thinking iterative process throughout our project. As there are many different types of users and each user has different needs, hence the design thinking process helps us to understand each user and the needs. With this, we managed to understand the specification better.

The key takeaway was the valuable experience of coding out a database application. This project helps us to understand the importance of using a database in a system and how it is implemented in a real world setting. Apart from learning databases at a deeper level, we also learnt about other web development technologies which will be very useful to us in the future.
